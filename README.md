# CausaOne-Sign: Causal Explainable One-Shot Signature Verification

This repository provides a modular implementation of the paper:

**"CausaOne-Sign: Causal Explainable One-Shot Signature Verification with Lightweight Cross-Modality Fusion"**

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `1_graph_construction.py`: Preprocess signature images and convert them into stroke-aware graphs.
- `2_graph_encoder.py`: Encode graph structures using a Graph Attention Network.
- `3_prototypical_training.py`: Implements episodic one-shot training using prototypical and contrastive losses.
- `4_graph_transformer_explainable.py`: Graph Transformer with attention and Individual Causal Attribution (ICA) for interpretability.
- `5_meta_learning_maml.py`: Implements Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) adaptation for unseen users.
- `6_distillation_and_pruning.py`: Applies model compression through pruning and knowledge distillation.
- `7_evaluation_metrics.py`: Evaluation utilities for accuracy, AUC, and F1-score.

## üìù Datasets Used
- **CEDAR**: English signatures with skilled forgeries.
- **SigComp2011**: Mixed-script benchmark for signature verification.
- **UTSig**: Persian offline signature dataset.
- **BHSig260**: Hindi and Bengali offline signatures.
